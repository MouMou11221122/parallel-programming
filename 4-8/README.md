### Problem Description
A prime number is a positive integer evenly divisible by exactly two positive integers: itself and 1. The first five prime numbers are 2, 3, 5,7, and 11. Sometimes two consecutive odd numbers are both prime. For example, the odd integers following 3, 5, and 11 are all prime numbers. However, the odd integer following 7 is not a prime number. Write a parallel program to determine, for all integers Iess than a given n, the number of times that two consecutive odd integers are both prime.
